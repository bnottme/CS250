How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Gather the requirements for the program and then create user stories that describe the software features required for the project. Having user stories helps with development because it gives a road map for developers, and they can prioritize features for each sprint.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Incorporating agile processes can significantly increase productivity and flexibility when developing software. The Scrum framework for managing work in weekly iterations called sprints is an excellent approach to developing software and involving stakeholders.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Communication, collaboration, and adaptability are vital to being a good team member in software development. These traits can improve productivity and ensure you function with other team members to complete work in each weekly sprint.
